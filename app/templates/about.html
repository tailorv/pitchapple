            <p class="my-2">   
                In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you. How do we make sure that you use your 1 minute to actually say something meaningful?
                This application allows users to use that one minute wisely. The users will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pitches are organized by category. You can have different categories like SPORTS, ATHELTICS, TECHNOLOGY, MUSIC , FASHION , INPIRATIONAL ,or any OTHER.(You don't have to use these categories, you can come up with your own creative categories) 
                The pitches should be arranged by category and the new posts should be displayed first.
